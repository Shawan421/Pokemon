<h1>What is Pokémon evolution?</h1>
<p>In Pokémon, evolution is the process where a Pokémon transforms into a stronger, more advanced form within its evolutionary line. This transformation typically involves a change in physical appearance, increased stats, and sometimes a new or improved movepool. Evolution is a core mechanic in the games, offering players a way to make their Pokémon more powerful and complete their Pokédex entries. </p>

<h1>Stellar evolutions</h1>
<p>Stellar evolution grants the power boost to all types of moves, but only once per type, unless in Tera Raid Battles where all moves are boosted without limit. It also changes the effects of Tera Blast, making it more powerful and super effective against other Terastallized Pokémon. </p>
